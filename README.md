# Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow and CNN

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset with TensorFlow.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The goal is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying these digits.
